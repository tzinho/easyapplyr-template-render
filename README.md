# AI-Powered Resume Builder: Enhancing User Experience

**1. Core AI Capabilities**

- **Resume Analysis:**

  - **Keyword Extraction:** Analyze resumes to extract relevant keywords and skills.
  - **Content Scoring:** Evaluate resume content based on factors like clarity, conciseness, ATS compatibility, and industry best practices.
  - **Skill Matching:** Compare user skills with job descriptions (if provided) to identify relevant skills and suggest improvements.

- **Resume Generation Assistance:**
  - **Content Suggestions:** Offer suggestions for resume sections (e.g., "Summary," "Skills," "Experience") based on user input.
  - **Bullet Point Refinement:** Help users craft impactful bullet points for their work experience by suggesting stronger verbs and quantifiable achievements.
  - **Template Recommendations:** Suggest suitable resume templates based on user's industry, career level, and desired job type.

**2. Implementation**

- **Choose an AI/ML Model:**

  - **Pre-trained Models:** Leverage pre-trained models like GPT-3 (OpenAI), Bard (Google), or Hugging Face Transformers for tasks like text generation, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis.
  - **Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune a pre-trained model on a dataset of high-quality resumes and job descriptions to improve its performance on resume-specific tasks.

- **Data Collection and Processing:**

  - Collect anonymized user data (resumes, job descriptions, user feedback) with proper consent.
  - Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., remove sensitive information, handle inconsistencies).
  - Create a structured dataset for training and evaluating the AI model.

- **AI Integration:**

  - **Real-time Feedback:** Provide real-time feedback as users type, highlighting potential issues or suggesting improvements.
  - **AI-Powered Features:** Implement features like:
    - **"Resume Analyzer"**: Analyze an uploaded resume and provide feedback on strengths and weaknesses.
    - **"Job Description Analyzer"**: Analyze a job description and suggest relevant skills and keywords for the resume.
    - **"Resume Builder Assistant"**: Offer suggestions for resume content, format, and structure.

- **User Interface:**
  - Create an intuitive user interface that seamlessly integrates AI-powered features.
  - Provide clear and concise explanations of AI-generated suggestions.
  - Allow users to easily accept or reject AI recommendations.

**3. Continuous Learning and Improvement**

- **User Feedback:** Collect user feedback on AI-generated suggestions and use it to improve model performance.
- **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different AI models and algorithms to find the best approach.
- **Regular Model Retraining:** Regularly retrain the AI model with new data to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.

**4. Ethical Considerations**

- **Data Privacy:** Handle user data responsibly and comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- **Bias Mitigation:** Strive to mitigate biases in the AI model to ensure fair and equitable outcomes for all users.
- **Transparency:** Be transparent with users about how AI is used in your resume builder.

**5. Tools and Technologies**

- **Cloud Platforms:** Utilize cloud platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure for AI model training, deployment, and scaling.
- **AI/ML Libraries:** Leverage libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn for model development and implementation.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Start with a Minimal Viable Product (MVP):** Begin with a basic AI-powered feature (e.g., keyword extraction) and gradually expand its capabilities.
- **Focus on User Experience:** Ensure that AI features are user-friendly and do not overwhelm users.
- **Prioritize User Feedback:** Continuously gather and incorporate user feedback to improve the AI and overall user experience.

**Resume considerations**

- **Each Template has a default sections:** I need to find a way to define the default sections in each template and when my user changes the chosen template i need to copy the default sections to resume

- **If there are no items on the required section, the section is hidden on the resume:** I need to validate this case on the template render

**Code**

```javascript
editor.insertNode({
  type: "list-item",
  children: [{ text: "" }],
});

const dateStringSchema = z.date().transform((date) => {
  const year = date.getFullYear();
  const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0");
  const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
});
```

```bash
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'
```

// A4 aspect ratio is 1:1.4142 (width:height)
// const paperWidth = 215.16; // px
// const paperHeight = Math.min(290, paperWidth \* 1.4142); // Maintain A4 ratio but cap at container height

# BUGS

When move the items need to update the previous values and the touched fields and the dirty fields

```js
useEffect(() => {
    const listener = (event: BeforeUnloadEvent) => {
     event.preventDefault();
   };

   window.addEventListener("beforeunload", listener);

   return () => window.removeEventListener("beforeunload", listener);
}, []);
```

## Summary depends on the experiences

# Bugs

## when i click to show dropdown on more options the app redirects to edit resume pages

## sidebar needs to be a fixed

## fields are with styles inherit

## refactor field date

## first insert the contact section is with undefined values
